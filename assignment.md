# Assignment

## Brief

Write the Python codes for the following questions.

## Instructions

Paste the answer as Python in the answer code section below each question.

### Question 1

Question: Implement a simple Thrift server and client that defines a `Student` struct with fields `name` (string), `age` (integer), and `courses` (list of strings). Include a service `School` with a method `enrollCourse` that takes a `Student` record and a course name, adds the course to the student's course list, and returns the updated `Student` record.

Answer:

```python
# Thrift schema (student.thrift)

# Thrift server (student_server.py)

# Thrift client (student_client.py)

```

### Question 2

Question: Implement a simple Protocol Buffers server and client that defines a `Book` message with fields `title` (string), `author` (string), and `page_count` (integer). Include a service `Library` with a method `checkoutBook` that takes a `Book` message and returns the same `Book` message.

Answer:

```python
# Protobuf schema (book.proto)

# Protobuf server (book_server.py)

# Protobuf client (book_client.py)

```
